Reflection

I think a hugely meaningful thing to me in this course was that I spent so much time
training up my programming endurance, and found myself capable of things I could
have never imagined myself doing in the past.  Memory management?  Pointers? Writing
my own API and Data structures libraries?  Amazing!  I have learned the fundamentals
in a very strong way this semester thanks to Matt's rigorous training.

I feel much faster, much more capable, and like I've been put through an invaluable
course.  I think that the concepts I learned here will carry me all the way to the grave in my computing endeavors.  I believe that reviewing these fundamentals so strongly will make me extremely capable in anything.

For instance, when I was working on my start up company,  it was peanuts compared to this course.  I had so much training in low level architecture that I felt more and more
connected with abstraction in computing. Matt made me and many other students feel
that we were capable of ascending to extreme highs with our intelligence as long
as we continued to train, be disciplined, and passionate about exploring. I feel as though I can work at any company, he has given me great confidence through tough coursework.

My least favorite aspect? Hard to say.  I don't think that this class should be changed.  It weeds out students who don't know what they want to do in life because it is very challenging, rigorous, and disciplined. I believe the course should only continue to grow in exploration.

It's been a great year.  I will always look back at this moment in being pivotol for my growth in computer science.
