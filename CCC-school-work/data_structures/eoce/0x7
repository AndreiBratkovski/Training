Personal Assessment

I believe that I deserve atleast an A in this course.  Not because I
"need" or "deserve" it, but because I believe the course was made for
students like me who wanted to crank it up a notch in their growth, constantly
being challenged, evolving in the understanding of computer theory.  I was always in class, turned in my work early,  ended up as rank 2 in the class, and helping all of my fellow students out.  I think that I excelled in the course out of passion, enjoyment, and a yearning for growth.

This was my favorite semester by far. I have a less intellectually challenging degree in music, yet I believe that I excel much more in computing. I plan to continue this path and believe I put in more than what I knew I was capable of in this course.

Best, Andrei Bratkovski
