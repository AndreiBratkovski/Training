The wo-o-o-orld is your 'at' command
UNIX Man
My printout is missin'
UNIX Man, please listen

At all?
UNIX Man, can you help me
Programs in lex, yacc and C
He's as wise as he can be

The new kernel boots, just like you had planned
UNIX Man
It's the tube that's blurry
UNIX Man, don't worry

And me?
Isn't he a bit like you
Cares not where /dev/null goes to
Knows the blocksize from 'du'

For nobody
Making all his UNIX .plans
Sitting in his UNIX LAN
He's a real UNIX Man
