# First I rewrote the width and size to be 150x300 in the
# sprite.c code, and then copied it over to a new program name
#
# so I had sprite, and sprite150300
# sprite would make an 800 x 600 image, and sprite150300 would
# make a 150 x 300 image.

# Then, I found my uid

id -u abratkov

# which came out to be 6082

# I then compile both sprite and sprite150300

gcc -o sprite sprite.c -lgd
gcc -o sprite150300 sprite150300.c -lgd

# Then I made 4 files for each mumber in my uid,
# six, zero, eight, and two
cp blank.dat six.dat
cp blank.dat eight.dat
cp blank.dat two.dat

# I then edited those files to contain 9's in the format
# that formed a number for each. I used 4's in the third digit
# so that it would be a blue eight ( as instructed ).
# then I ran the program on each of these files to create png images
#

cp six.dat sprite.dat
./sprite150300 six.png

cp eight.dat sprite.dat
./sprite150300 eight.png

cp two.dat sprite.dat
./sprite150300 two.png

cp zero.dat sprite.dat
./sprite150300 zero.png

#
# Afterwards I appended all of these images together left to right
# using the convert function
#
convert +append six.png zero.png eight.png two.png uid.png

# now we have the image in uid.png. Lastly, I force resized the image
# to be 800x600
#
convert -resize 800x600! uid.png uidsize.png

# its complete! then I renamed the file to uidsize.png to uidCOMPLETE.png
mv uidsize.png uidCOMPLETE.png
