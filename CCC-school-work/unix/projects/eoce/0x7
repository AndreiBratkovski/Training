0x7 What You Leave Behind- UNIX EOCE

What grade do I feel I deserve for this course and why?

Funnily enough, even though I was "rank 1 across the board" I felt that even though 
I did well on all of the projects, I have a lot more to learn about all of the unix 
tools.  I feel more comfortable with discrete and data although others would find it 
more challenging. I still believe I deserve an A for my timeliness, hard work, and overall grade, but I need to continue studying unix fundamentals.

This is because unix has so many power tools to offer that require a lot of training, like sed and regex.  These things I understand will take me time and I accept this, but Matt gave me a solid foundation to work from.  I feel comfortable searching the web and manual pages to find solutions which will help me move forward that much more quickly.

I'm grateful for this course and all of the challenges it brought me. I feel like I can go into my mobile app startup and really run a server with much more competence now.
