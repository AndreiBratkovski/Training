0x6 - Image in the Sand
Andrei Bratkovski eoce

Of all the work I've done this semester, I found that the shell
scripting was the most meaningful to me because it had me combine all
of my unix lessons into one. I used linux commands as well as programmatic
practice to solve problems and it taught me the most as far as projects go. I also
think that puzzle boxes were great because they were practice in using very 
important manipulation tools in unix.

I feel that this course is the best course ever in computing because Every single
developer should take it.  Far too often do people flock to the newest technology without realizing the power behing using a unix operating system.  Not only that, but most
employers need engineers who can think for themselves and navigate a command line 
because of the power behind it. It also is the foundation for our learning.

My least favorite aspect?  I couldn't think of one off hand, other than seeing other 
students not take a class seriously when it is the best class ever. I took away a ton of learning from this course.  I also have much more practice ahead of me (regex).

I suggest that Matt keeps teaching this of course, and that every computing department keeps this course a requirement.
