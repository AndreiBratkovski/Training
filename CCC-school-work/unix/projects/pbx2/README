Puzzlebox: NEXT
===============
You got this far- good!

Now the real fun begins. There is a file in the archive
called 'enigmatic.file'; its password is "e7c8f42c" (without the quotes).

Decrypt and extract it from the archive.

Look inside it; this data is encoded somehow. Determine the potential
patterns that may govern it, and explore different ways of decoding it.

Be careful, exactness can matter!

As you go along, apply your senses of pattern matching to unjumble
what you have gotten. As always- avoid manual work: use tools on the
system to help you.

You will be assembling the entire gamut of steps performed into a script
called "pbx1steps" that you will submit at the conclusion of the project;
if you execute this script, it should non-interactively be able to copy,
unravel, and produce the end result (basically from the initial copy to
just prior to the final submit step).

The unraveled product (something ordered, visual, with some wit) should
be placed in a file called 'pbx2.results', which is what you are to
submit upon project completion:
