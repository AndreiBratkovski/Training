numbers - helper tools for UNIX upf0 project
============================================
numbers is a collection of simple C programs whose sole purpose is
to display the numeric representation of their namesake to STDOUT.
That is it.

This project also helps to give user's experience in compiling and
installing software so that they can make use of it in their own
endeavors.

How to compile
==============
Before you can use numbers, you first need to compile the source
code. This has been simplified with the use of a Makefile. All you
have to do (provided a capable C compiler is installed), is to type
'make' at the command-line and the process should commence. You
will see each tool be compiled, and hopefully in a successful
fashion.

How to install
==============
In order to make use of numbers for your endeavors, you will need
to install them into some directory in your PATH. Your personal bin
directory, located in the base of your home directory will do fine.

To install numbers into your own bin directory, simply run:

	make install

at the prompt. Once done you should be all set. Try seeing if the
tools are now available to you (try running 'three' or any of the
other tools- if it doesn't come back saying "No such file or
directory", then the install was successful).

If not you may want to try logging out and logging back in.

How to use
==========
The various "numbers", named for the single digit values they 
display to STDOUT, are simple and straightforward. They require
nor take any input, and only display their pertinent value to 
STDOUT.
