PuzzleBox (pbx1)
================
Once again, your skills are put to the test; you are given a data file
that contains a scrambled ASCII art image that you must unravel and 
re-assemble, using only non-interactive command-line tools (no text
editors! no assistive scripts you didn't write!)

The final "image" can be identified by a top and bottom row of the 
uppercase and lowercase vowels of the alphabet. Top row will be the
uppercase vowels, bottom row the lowercase.

The left and right-most columns contain a sequential line count, 
ranging from 000 to 031 in octal.

The flow of data is counter-clockwise: it will increment top to
bottom along the left margin, increment left to right along the
bottom margin, increment bottom to top along the right margin, and
then increment right to left along the top margin.

Use your experiences from the projects you've worked on, the various
experimentation you've done in your own time, referencing the manual
pages, and applying critical reasoning and common sense to solve this
puzzle.

Some tools you may want to investigate:
        - cat(1)
        - cut(1)
        - grep(1)
        - head(1)
        - paste(1)
        - sort(1)
        - tail(1)
        - tr(1)
        - uudecode(1)
        - uniq(1)

You can verify your results by comparing md5sum hashes- I have stored
the md5sum hash inside the MANIFEST file in the project public
directory (just as I've done for your other recent projects).

Keep track of your steps, and place them in a working non-interactive
script by the name of "pbx1steps", which you will submit along with
your final ASCII art image, stored in a file called: "pbx1.results"

Your "pbx1steps" file, while I would hope you make use of various
shell facilities (like quotes, variables, wildcards), please do have
a focus on having the file be readable with respect to comments and
general file name references.

To submit, do the following:

    submit unix pbx1 pbx1.results pbx1steps

Some things I will be looking for:

    *:pbx1:submitted pbx1.results file via submit tool
    *:pbx1:submitted pbx1steps file via submit tool
    *:pbx1:pbx1.results and pbx1steps pushed to lab46 repository
    *:pbx1:pbx1.results is correctly unscrambled and assembled
    *:pbx1:pbx1.results md5sum matches project MANIFEST
    *:pbx1:pbx1steps has valid list of non-interactive instructions
    *:pbx1:pbx1steps uses shell features like wildcards, IO redir
    *:pbx1:pbx1steps contains comments explaining process
    *:pbx1:pbx1steps sets up local project directories
    *:pbx1:pbx1steps copy data files with with absolute path
    *:pbx1:pbx1steps all other paths are relative
    *:pbx1:pbx1steps automates the project when executed
    *:pbx1:pbx1steps only outputs user-generated messages
