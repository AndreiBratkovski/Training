Believe it or not, I believe that discrete was much more
challenging for me than data structures. I felt that I had to
dig much deeper into the understanding of how to apply combinatorics.

Of all of the work I have done this semester, I have always somehow managed
to find a solution to the problem, if not, a very close one.  I know that this won't
"fly" in my first engineering job, meaning that I can't get a close answer but
need the exact answer, however I believe that the process was the most important 
for me.  Discrete was able to reveal to me my weaknesses and strengths in 
programming and problem solving. I was able to see which areas I am strong in,
 (syntactic, control flow), and which I am weak in, ( understanind algorithms slowly 
rather than quickly, and always looking to a reference to learn from).

I wish I was faster at coming up with algorithms and answers, but I give my best. I 
believe that I earned atleast an A, coming up as rank 2 on the leaderboard and 
always finding a solution/giving my best.  However, I wish I was stronger in the 
ability to implement new programs/ideas that were presented to me in discrete structures.

I believe that this class was insanely useful in teaching me many different ways
to think no matter how hard on myself I have been this semester with regards to
Matt's rigorous coursework.  My least favorite aspect is when I feel like a solution does not come quickly, and being forced to think in new ways.  However, I find that this 
is what makes the class so valuable and important for students like me.  

My suggestion for this course honestly is to keep it the way it is. It is a perfect 
course for weeding out those who are not prepared/interested for the mammoth that is
computer science.  It has personally tested my ability to intense challenges. And I 
thought I'd be smart enough to breeze through, however it required a constant, intense effort.
